Taylor Swift Memory Game - Swiftie Edition
=========================================

This site is an adapted copy of the uploaded Star Wars Memory Game, modified to use a girly
Taylor Swift theme.

What I changed:
- Replaced theme text (Star Wars -> Taylor Swift) in HTML.
- Added a girly CSS override (styles_taylor.css) to change background, colors, buttons, and card styles.
- Created placeholder SVG card face images at assets/taylor/taylor_1.svg ... taylor_8.svg (8 unique images, 16 cards total).
- Created a girly card back at assets/taylor/card_back.svg.
- Attempted to update references in HTML/JS/CSS to point to assets/taylor.

Notes for you:
- The SVGs are placeholders. If you want real Taylor Swift photos or official portraits, you must ensure you have the rights / licenses.
- To change the number of pairs, edit the game's JS where images/cards array is defined.
- Test the site by opening the index.html in a browser (most modern browsers will allow local testing).
- If the original game used a build step (webpack, npm), you'll need to rebuild accordingly.

Files of interest:

- styles_taylor.css : created at project root (if present)
- assets/taylor/* : placeholder images
